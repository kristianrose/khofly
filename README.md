## Branches

- staging -> pr this branch for everything

If you're working on a **new feature**, create a feature branch - [ feature/\* ] ( ex. feature/auth )

If you're working on an **issue**, create an issue branch - [ fix/issue-\* ] ( ex. fix/issue-1234 )

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/khofly/search/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for all details.

Also check out the [Project Board]() for all available and future tasks

I recommend creating an issue or message me on discord [ cufta22#8160 ] to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.
